//! The engine ↔ gateway boundary contract (ADR 0024, increment 2).
//!
//! The engine depends on its collaborators as TRAITS, never on the concrete `AppState`. The
//! gateway builds the concrete impls (reqwest client, `CapabilityFacade`, stores) and injects
//! them. Kept deliberately decoupled — only `serde_json` crosses here, so the engine stays a
//! low-level, mockable crate (no heavy `subagents`/`capabilities`/reqwest deps leak in).
//!
//! Two seams are defined now (the two ADR 0024 names). The engine's OWN output-event contract
//! (the `GenerateStreamEvent` sink) is resolved when the loop body itself moves (increment 5),
//! since that decides where `GenerateStreamEvent` should live (today it sits in the heavy
//! `subagents` crate — the wrong direction for the engine to depend on).
