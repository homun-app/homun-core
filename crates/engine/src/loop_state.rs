//! The agent loop's turn-carried state (ADR 0024, increment 5, Point 4).
//!
//! The single guarded ReAct loop (motore #1) still runs inline in the gateway
//! (`stream_chat_via_openai`), but its loop-carried locals are bundled here so the
//! struct is defined at its eventual destination: when the loop body relocates into
//! this crate (Point 5, behind `HOMUN_ENGINE_CRATE`) it will own a `&mut LoopState`
//! and mutate these fields directly — no second move. Adopting it in-place first
//! (gateway constructs it, the inline loop mutates it) keeps every slice
//! behavior-preserving and lets the compiler prove the field set is complete.
//!
//! Scope discipline: this holds ONLY state that survives across rounds (turn-carried).
//! Per-round locals (e.g. the approval `pending_confirm` flag, reset each iteration)
//! stay in the loop. This grows across slices — Point 4a lands the pure accumulators,
//! Point 4b adds `messages`/`plan` (as `serde_json::Value`, since `ExecutionPlan` lives
//! in a downstream crate the leaf `engine` can't reference) and the provider binding;
//! browser state stays gateway-side behind the temporary seam until ADR 0025.
